<p><img src="{% static 'img/spewid2.jpg' %}" alt="img/spewid5.jpg" style="width: 170px; height: 170px; margin-right: 15px;">My name is Mr. Hawkins Ouma Agalloh.Am the key founder of Konya disability support organization (spewid) holding current position of operations director. Am holding higher diploma in medical psychology and certificates in trauma counseling and management from AMREF INTERNATIONAL.I have worked    with  numerous research institution/organization e.g. KEMRI-JICA in 2004 to 2007 at kemri Kisumu headquarters,2008 to 2010 worked with university of Manitoba was undertaking research on drug resistancy at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga teaching and referral lead by key principal investigator KEMRI DR. Songok.worked with CDC at center for clinical research with GAP CT Children’s department 2010 to 2014 worked with FACES RCTP NYANZA Care and treatment program. Worked with ICAP From 2014 to 2017.</p>
<p>
In 2018 September started community based  program bearing a community name Konya disability support organization spewid supporting people with disability initiative. Through my field report and experience gained from this survey, it has come out very clear from source documents retrieved that people living with disability are neglected. The aim of this study is purposely to find out challenges facing people with disability in access to health care services and way forward.SPEWID INNITIATIVE is to assess the accessibility of health services, education and physical infrastructures e.g. public buildings in Kisumu-Konya location. Findings revealed that nearly 99% of the public buildings, health facilities and other institutions are not favorable to the people living with disability.</p>
<p>
Observation shows that there is much need to improve the accessibility where construction building, creating corridors, parks for people living disability. Most of the building or structures lacks guideline on how to make buildings accessible for wheel chair users.</p>
<p>
Have done a survey in most of public health institutions and malls and learnt that there is no specific toilets designed for people living with disability. Health sectors there is incomplete details or information using MOH 362 as one of the indicators. Most of the documentation on the disability column is not helping a person with disability in key population study.</p>
<p>
Accessibility in this research for Konya Disability Support Organization ( SPEWID INITIATIVE ) simply implies, making public places and institutions favorable and accessible to every individual regardless of his or her disability , giving right and capability to participate in public activities and ensuring quality services offered to them. As a researcher, disability is a functional or structural limitation within the individual caused by physical, mental, sensory impairment.
