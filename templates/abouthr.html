<p> <img src="{% static 'img/spewid5.jpg' %}" alt="img/spewid5.jpg" style="width: 170px; height: 170px; margin-right: 15px;">Organizational commitment is the degree to which individual employees are emotionally attached to their organizations (Mowday, Steers, & Porter, 1979). Organizational commitment has triggered a huge amount of scholarly attention over the past decades, as it has been shown to relate to performance improvement and a decrease in withdrawal behaviors and turnover, as well as improvement in employees' general wellbeing. As diversity in the workforce continues to be a large source of discussion, research has attempted to examine organizational commitment from diverse groups such as female employees and older workers. However, there has been scarcity of research related to the organizational commitment of people with disabilities. People with disabilities are the largest minority in our nation.</p>
<p>
While there is a substantial amount of research on issues that people with disabilities face in the workplace, little, if any, research examined why people with disabilities may or may not be committed to their organizations of employment. Thus, organizational commitment from this specific minority group deserves a fair amount of scholarly attention. One of the most cited issues people with disabilities face in the workplace is negative attitudes toward this group. Wittmer and Wilson (2010) cited several myths about employees with disabilities, such as poorer job performance and higher workman's compensation rates, which lead to these negative types of attitudes. These attitudes are often held at the highest levels within the organization and are likely to spread to the lower levels. Under my leadership, I will strengthen awareness to both employees who are leaving with disability and those that are not to create eqity and equality within the organization. </p>
<p>
Konya Disability Support Organization will provide more job opportunities to people leaving with disability. Of the total number of those that the organization will hire, more than a half will be those that are disabled. The organization will create a climate that promotes diversity, tolerance, and support to all employees regardless of their physical or mental nature. This is because an organizational climate that is pro diversity can positively impact treatment towards workers with disabilities and may be the key to their successful integration in the workplace. A climate that supports diversity can shape supervisors' as well as coworkers' attitudes and obligations towards employees with disabilities, and motivates employees without disabilities to offer help to employees with disabilities.</p>
<p>
The current study further specifies diversity climate to examine pro-disability climate. The development of a pro-disability climate is a result of an organization's efforts to promote inclusion of people with disabilities typically through human resource policies and initiatives to create a more inclusive workplace. Such an inclusive climate "advocates fair human resource policies and socially integrates underrepresented employees. An organization with a pro-disability climate tends to value diversity as an asset and proactively capitalizes on its benefits in promoting the professional growth of their employees and the overall growth of the organization itself. Perceptions of a pro-diversity climate are derived from such things as a the proportion of managers who have undergone disabilities awareness training, managers' awareness of disability policies and practices, and from managers' perceptions that policies are made from a genuine commitment to people with disabilities and not out of legal compliance. Employees with disabilities may then feel more embedded within the organization, perceive more support, have a better quality relationship with their immediate supervisor, feel better with their job demands, have higher organizational commitment, and experience less disability-related bias. And for this the department of Human Resource will organize such trainings either on-job or off-job. As a policy maker in the organization, I will champion for policies that advocate for the rights of people leaving with disability (PLWD).</p>
<p>
The department will come up with organizations policies that will touch on the office premises and all the office utilities within the office to be user friendly to both the disabled and the abled. The organization will build ramps, user friendly washrooms, brails, sensor sticks etc. my department will give first priority to applicants who are disabled and will increase recruitment, hiring, and retention of people with disabilities, the organization will implement strategies for hiring and retaining workers with disabilities, including increasing access to appropriate accessible technologies, and ensuring the accessibility of physical and virtual workspaces.</p>
<p>
Konya Disability Support Organization is here to give pavilion of hope to Konya Community as a whole and most importantly and specifically to those members of the community that leave with disability. We shall also give voice to the voiceless pwld as well as open job opportunities to the neglected group. We as a family of Konya Disability Support Group welcome you to our organization with open arms.</p>
